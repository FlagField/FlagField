## [Server](https://github.com/mukeran/FlagField-Server)

FlagField-Server is FlagField's core server. It handles the request from the clients and manage the docker images, containers, resources and problems.

It is based on Go, with gin and gorm.

## [Web](https://github.com/mukeran/FlagField-Web)

FlagField-Web is FlagField's official front end.  It acts as the interface between user and the server.

It is based on Vue, Vuex and Buefy (default theme).

## Goal

It is originally designed for a practice course in college.

But it will be an sustainable platform project for CTFers.
